<es-clause title="Applying theOperator" anchor="sec-applying-the-mod-operator">
  <p>The <code>%</code> operator yields the remainder of its operands from an implied division; the
  left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>In C and C++, the remainder operator accepts only integral operands; in ECMAScript, it also
    accepts floating-point operands.</p>
  </es-note>

  <p>The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the <code>%</code> operator
  is not the same as the “remainder” operation defined by IEEE 754. The IEEE 754 “remainder”
  operation computes the remainder from a rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its
  behaviour is not analogous to that of the usual integer remainder operator. Instead the
  ECMAScript language defines <code>%</code> on floating-point operations to behave in a manner
  analogous to that of the Java integer remainder operator; this may be compared with the C library
  function fmod.</p>

  <p>The result of an ECMAScript floating-point remainder operation is determined by the rules of
  IEEE arithmetic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sign of the result equals the sign of the dividend.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both, the result is
      <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the result equals the
      dividend.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is nonzero and finite, the result is the same as
      the dividend.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved,
      the floating-point remainder r from a dividend n and a divisor d is defined by the
      mathematical relation r = n − (d × q) where q is an integer that is negative only if n/d is
      negative and positive only if n/d is positive, and whose magnitude is as large as possible
      without exceeding the magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of n and d. r is computed
      and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</es-clause>
