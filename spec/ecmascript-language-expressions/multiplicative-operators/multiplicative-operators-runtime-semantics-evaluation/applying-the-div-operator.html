<es-clause title="Applying theOperator" anchor="sec-applying-the-div-operator">
  <p>The <code>/</code> operator performs division, producing the quotient of its operands. The
  left operand is the dividend and the right operand is the divisor. ECMAScript does not perform
  integer division. The operands and result of all division operations are double-precision
  floating-point numbers. The result of division is determined by the specification of IEEE 754
  arithmetic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same sign, negative if the
      operands have different signs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of an infinity by an infinity results in <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of an infinity by a zero results in an infinity. The sign is determined by the
      rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of an infinity by a nonzero finite value results in a signed infinity. The sign
      is determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of a finite value by an infinity results in zero. The sign is determined by the
      rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of a zero by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>; division of zero by any other finite
      value results in zero, with the sign determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Division of a nonzero finite value by a zero results in a signed infinity. The sign is
      determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor <b>NaN</b> is involved,
      the quotient is computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754
      round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows;
      the result is then an infinity of appropriate sign. If the magnitude is too small to
      represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of the appropriate sign. The
      ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE 754.</p>
