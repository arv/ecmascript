<es-clause title="Applying theOperator" anchor="sec-applying-the-mul-operator">
  <p>The <code>*</code> operator performs multiplication, producing the product of its operands.
  Multiplication is commutative. Multiplication is not always associative in ECMAScript, because of
  finite precision.</p>

  <p>The result of a floating-point multiplication is governed by the rules of IEEE 754 binary
  double-precision arithmetic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sign of the result is positive if both operands have the same sign, negative if the
      operands have different signs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a zero results in <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Multiplication of an infinity by an infinity results in an infinity. The sign is
      determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Multiplication of an infinity by a finite nonzero value results in a signed infinity. The
      sign is determined by the rule already stated above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity nor NaN is involved, the product is
      computed and rounded to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode.
      If the magnitude is too large to represent, the result is then an infinity of appropriate
      sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result is then a zero of appropriate
      sign. The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by IEEE
      754.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
