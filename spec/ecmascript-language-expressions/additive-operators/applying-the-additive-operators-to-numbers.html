<es-clause title="Applying the Additive Operators to Numbers" anchor=
"sec-applying-the-additive-operators-to-numbers">
  <p>The <code>+</code> operator performs addition when applied to two operands of numeric type,
  producing the sum of the operands. The <code>-</code> operator performs subtraction, producing
  the difference of two numeric operands.</p>

  <p>Addition is a commutative operation, but not always associative.</p>

  <p>The result of an addition is determined using the rules of IEEE 754 binary double-precision
  arithmetic:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If either operand is <b>NaN</b>, the result is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of two infinities of opposite sign is <b>NaN</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of two infinities of the same sign is the infinity of that sign.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of an infinity and a finite value is equal to the infinite operand.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of two negative zeroes is <b>−0</b>. The sum of two positive zeroes, or of two
      zeroes of opposite sign, is <b>+0</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of a zero and a nonzero finite value is equal to the nonzero operand.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The sum of two nonzero finite values of the same magnitude and opposite sign is
      <b>+0</b>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In the remaining cases, where neither an infinity, nor a zero, nor NaN is involved, and
      the operands have the same sign or have different magnitudes, the sum is computed and rounded
      to the nearest representable value using IEEE 754 round-to-nearest mode. If the magnitude is
      too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is then an infinity of
      appropriate sign. The ECMAScript language requires support of gradual underflow as defined by
      IEEE 754.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <es-note>
    <p>The <code>-</code> operator performs subtraction when applied to two operands of numeric
    type, producing the difference of its operands; the left operand is the minuend and the right
    operand is the subtrahend. Given numeric operands <es-nt>a</es-nt> and <es-nt>b</es-nt>, it is
    always the case that <i>a–b</i> produces the same result as <i>a +(–b)</i>.</p>
