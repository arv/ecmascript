  <p>Map objects are collections of key/value pairs where both the keys and values may be arbitrary
  <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language values</es-xref>. A distinct
  key value may only occur in one key/value pair within the Mapâ€™s collection. Distinct key values
  as discriminated using the a comparision algorithm that is selected when the Map is created.</p>

  <p>A Map object can iterate its elements in insertion order. Map object must be implemented using
  either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear
  on the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in this Map objects
  specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of Map objects. It
  is not intended to be a viable implementation model.</p>
