<es-clause title="Set Objects" anchor="sec-set-objects">
  <p>Set objects are collections of <a href="#sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language
  values</a> . A distinct value may only occur once as an element of a Setâ€™s collection. Distinct
  values are discriminated using a comparision algorithm that is selected when the Set is
  created.</p>

  <p>A Set object can iterate its elements in insertion order. Set objects must be implemented
  using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are
  sublinear on the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in this Set
  objects specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of Set
  objects. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.</p>
