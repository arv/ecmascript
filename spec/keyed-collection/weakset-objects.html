<es-clause title="WeakSet Objects" anchor="sec-weakset-objects">
  <p>WeakSet objects are collections of objects. A distinct object may only occur once as an
  element of a WeakSetâ€™s collection. A WeakSet may be queried to see if it contains a specific
  object, but no mechanisms is provided for enumerating the objects it holds. If an object that is
  contain by a WeakSet is only reachable by following a chain of references that start within that
  WeakSet, then that object is inaccessible and is automatically removed from the WeakSet. WeakSet
  implementations must detect and remove such objects and any associated resources.</p>

  <p>An implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between the time an object
  contained in a WeakSet becomes inaccessible and the time when the object is removed from the
  WeakSet. If this latency was observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of
  indeterminacy that could impact program execution.&nbsp; For that reason, an ECMAScript
  implementation must not provide any means to determine if a WeakSet contains a particular object
  that does not require the observer to present the observed object.</p>

  <p>WeakSet objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on
  average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection. The
  data structure used in this WeakSet objects specification is only intended to describe the
  required observable semantics of WeakSet objects. It is not intended to be a viable
  implementation model.</p>
