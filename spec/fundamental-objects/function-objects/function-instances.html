<es-clause title="Function Instances" anchor="sec-function-instances">
  <p>Every function instance is an <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-function-objects">ECMAScript
  function object</es-xref> and has the internal slots listed in <a href="#table-26">Table 26</a>
  .</p>

  <p>Function instances that correspond to strict mode functions and function instances created
  using the <b><es-xref target="sec-function.prototype.bind">Function.prototype.bind</es-xref>
  method</b> (<es-xref target="sec-function.prototype.bind">19.2.3.2</es-xref>) have properties
  named <span class="value">caller</span> and <code>arguments</code> that throw a <b>TypeError</b>
  exception. An ECMAScript implementation must not associate any implementation specific behaviour
  with accesses of these properties from strict mode function code.</p>

  <p>The Function instances have the following properties:</p>

  <es-clause title="length" anchor="sec-function-instances-length">
    <p>The value of the <code>length</code> property is an integer that indicates the typical
    number of arguments expected by the function. However, the language permits the function to be
    invoked with some other number of arguments. The behaviour of a function when invoked on a
    number of arguments other than the number specified by its <code>length</code> property depends
    on the function. This property has the attributes {&nbsp;[[Writable]]: <b>false</b>,
    [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b>&nbsp;}.</p>
  </es-clause>

  <es-clause title="name" anchor="sec-name">
    <p>The value of the <code>name</code> property is an String that is descriptive of the
    function. The name has no semantic significance but is typically a variable or property name
    that is used to refer to the function at its point of definition in ECMAScript code. This
    property has the attributes {&nbsp;[[Writable]]: <b>false</b>, [[Enumerable]]: <b>false</b>,
    [[Configurable]]: <b>true</b>&nbsp;}.</p>

    <p>Anonymous functions objects that do not have a contextual name associated with them by this
    specification do not have a <code>name</code> own property but inherit the <code>name</code>
    property of %FunctionPrototype%.</p>

    <p class="Note">Function objects created using <code><es-xref target=
    "sec-function.prototype.bind">Function.prototype.bind</es-xref></code> do not have a
    <code>name</code> property.</p>
