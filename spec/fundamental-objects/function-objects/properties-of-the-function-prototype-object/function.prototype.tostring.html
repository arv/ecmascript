<es-clause title="Function.prototype.toString ( )" anchor="sec-function.prototype.tostring">
  <p>An implementation-dependent String source code representation of the <b>this</b> object is
  returned. This representation has the syntax of a <es-nt>FunctionDeclaration</es-nt>
  <i>FunctionExpression</i>, <i>GeneratorDeclaration, GeneratorExpession, ClassDeclaration</i>,
  <i>ClassExpression</i>, <i>ArrowFunction</i>, <i>MethodDefinition</i>, or <i>GeneratorMethod</i>
  depending upon the actual characteristics of the object. In particular that the use and placement
  of white space, line terminators, and semicolons within the representation String is
  implementation-dependent.</p>

  <p>If the object was defined using ECMAScript code and the returned string representation is in
  the form of a <es-nt>FunctionDeclaration</es-nt> <i>FunctionExpression</i>,
  <i>GeneratorDeclaration, GeneratorExpession, ClassDeclaration</i>, <i>ClassExpression</i>, or
  <i>ArrowFunction</i> then the representation must be such that if the string is evaluated, using
  <code>eval</code> in a lexical context that is equivalent to the lexical context used to create
  the original object, it will result in a new functionally equivalent object. The returned source
  code must not mention freely any variables that were not mentioned freely by the original
  function’s source code, even if these “extra” names were originally in scope. If the source code
  string does meet these criteria then it must be a string for which <code>eval</code> will throw a
  <b>SyntaxError</b> exception.</p>

  <p>The <code>toString</code> function is not generic; it throws a <b>TypeError</b> exception if
  its <b>this</b> value does not have a [[Call]] internal method. Therefore, it cannot be
  transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.</p>
