<es-clause title="Automatic Semicolon Insertion" anchor="sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">
  <p>Certain ECMAScript statements (empty statement, let and const declarations, variable
  statement, expression statement, <code>debugger</code> statement, <code>continue</code>
  statement, <code>break</code> statement, <code>return</code> statement, and <code>throw</code>
  statement) must be terminated with semicolons. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in
  the source text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in
  certain situations. These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically
  inserted into the source code token stream in those situations.</p>
