<es-clause title="The Strict Variant of ECMAScript" anchor="sec-strict-variant-of-ecmascript">
  <p>The ECMAScript Language recognises the possibility that some users of the language may wish to
  restrict their usage of some features available in the language. They might do so in the
  interests of security, to avoid what they consider to be error-prone features, to get enhanced
  error checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this possibility,
  ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The strict variant of the language excludes
  some specific syntactic and semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the
  detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also specifies additional error
  conditions that must be reported by throwing error exceptions in situations that are not
  specified as errors by the non-strict form of the language.</p>

  <p>The strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the <i>strict mode</i> of the
  language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics of ECMAScript is
  explicitly made at the level of individual ECMAScript code units. Because strict mode is selected
  at the level of a syntactic code unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that have local
  effect within such a code unit. Strict mode does not restrict or modify any aspect of the
  ECMAScript semantics that must operate consistently across multiple code units. A complete
  ECMAScript program may be composed for both strict mode and non-strict mode ECMAScript code
  units. In this case, strict mode only applies when actually executing code that is defined within
  a <es-xref target="sec-strict-mode-code">strict mode code</es-xref> unit.</p>

  <p>In order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation must implement both
  the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the strict mode variant of the ECMAScript language
  as defined by this specification. In addition, an implementation must support the combination of
  unrestricted and <es-xref target="sec-strict-mode-code">strict mode code</es-xref> units into a
  single composite program.</p>
