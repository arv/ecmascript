<es-clause title="ECMAScript Overview" anchor="sec-ecmascript-overview">
  <p>The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript—not all parts of the language are
  described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an
  ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an <b><i>object</i></b>
  is a collection of <b><i>properties</i></b> each with zero or more <b><i>attributes</i></b> that
  determine how each property can be used—for example, when the Writable attribute for a property
  is set to <b>false</b>, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to change the value of the
  property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, <b><i>primitive
  values</i></b>, or <b><i>functions</i></b>. A primitive value is a member of one of the following
  built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Number</b>, <b>Symbol</b> and
  <b>String</b>; an object is a member of the remaining built-in type <b>Object</b>; and a function
  is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is a
  <b><i>method</i></b>.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript defines a collection of <b><i>built-in objects</i></b> that round out the
  definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object, the
  <b>Object</b> object, the <b>Function</b> object, the <b>Array</b> object, the <b>String</b>
  object, the <b>Boolean</b> object, the <b>Number</b> object, the <b>Math</b> object, the
  <b>Date</b> object, the <b>RegExp</b> object, the <b>JSON</b> object, and the Error objects
  <b>Error, EvalError</b>, <b>RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError</b> and
  <b><es-xref target=
  "sec-constructor-properties-of-the-global-object-urierror">URIError</es-xref></b>.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in <b><i>operators</i></b>. ECMAScript operators
  include various unary operations, multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift
  operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical
  operators, assignment operators, and the comma operator.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax is relaxed to enable
  it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language. For example, a variable is not required to have
  its type declared nor are types associated with properties, and defined functions are not
  required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to them.</p>
