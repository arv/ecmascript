  <p>This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and
  manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not
  intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this
  specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected
  that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and
  other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects,
  whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate
  that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be
  called from an ECMAScript program.</p>

  <p>A <b><i>scripting language</i></b> is a programming language that is used to manipulate,
  customise, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful
  functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a
  mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is
  said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of
  the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and
  non-professional programmers. ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting
  language, but has become widely used as a general purpose programming language.</p>

  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a <b><i>Web scripting language</i></b>, providing a
  mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a
  Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used both as a general propose
  programming language and to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host
  environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular
  host environment.</p>

  <p>Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other programming languages;
  in particular C, Java™, Self, and Scheme as described in:</p>

  <es-clause title="Organization of This Specification" anchor=
  "sec-organization-of-this-specification">
    <p>The remainder of this specification is organized as follows:</p>

    <p>Clause 5 defines the notational conventions used throughout the specification.</p>

    <p>Clauses 6-9 define the execution environment within which ECMAScript programs operate.</p>

    <p>Clauses 10-16 define the actual ECMAScript programming language includings its syntactic
    encoding and the execution semantics of all language features.</p>

    <p>Clauses 17-26 define the ECMAScript standard library. It includes the definitions of all of
    the standard objects that are available for use by ECMAScript programs as they execute.</p>
