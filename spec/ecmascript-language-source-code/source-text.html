  <h2>Syntax</h2>

  <es-production name="SourceCharacter" type="lexical">
    <es-rhs><es-gprose>any Unicode code point</es-gprose></es-rhs>
  </es-production>

  <p>The ECMAScript code is expressed using Unicode, version 5.1 or later. ECMAScript source text
  is a sequence of code points. All Unicode code point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including
  surrogate code points, may occur in source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The
  actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is not relevant to this
  specification. Regardless of the external source text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript
  implementation processes the source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of
  <es-nt>SourceCharacter</es-nt> values. Each <es-nt>SourceCharacter</es-nt> being a Unicode code
  point. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalisation of
  text, or behave as though they were performing normalisation of text.</p>

  <p>The components of a combining character sequence are treated as individual Unicode code points
  even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>In string literals, regular expression literals,template literals and identifiers, any
    Unicode code point may also be expressed using Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express
    a code point’s numeric value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored
    as part of the comment.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of Unicode escape
    sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape sequence <code>\u000A</code>, for example,
    occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode character
    <code>000A</code> is line feed) and therefore the next character is not part of the comment.
    Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence <code>\u000A</code> occurs within a string literal in
    a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a
    string literal—one must write <code>\n</code> instead of <code>\u000A</code> to cause a line
    feed to be part of the string value of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode
    escape sequence occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot contribute
    to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a string
    literal in an ECMAScript program always contributes a Unicode code unit or code point
    (depending upon the first of the escape) to the literal and is never interpreted as a line
    terminator or as a quote mark that might terminate the string literal.</p>
