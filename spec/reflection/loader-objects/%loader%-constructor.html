<es-clause title="The %Loader% Constructor" anchor="sec-%loader%-constructor">
  <p>The %Loader% intrinsic object is the constructor for Loader objects. When %Loader% is called
  as a function rather than as a constructor, it initialises its <b>this</b> value with the
  internal state necessary to support the %Loader%<code>.prototype</code> built-in methods.</p>

  <p>The %Loader% constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the value in an
  <code>extends</code> clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that intend to support
  the specified Loader behaviour must include a <code>super</code> call to %Loader%.</p>

  <es-clause title="new %Loader% ( ... argumentsList )" anchor="sec-new-%loader%-argumentslist">
    <p>When %Loader% is called as part of a <code>new</code> expression it is a constructor: it
    initialises a newly created object. It performs the following steps:</p>

    <ol class="proc">
      <li>Let <i>F</i> be the %Loader% function object on which the <code>new</code> operator was
      applied.</li>

      <li>Let <i>argumentsList</i> be the <i>argumentsList</i> argument of the [[Construct]]
      internal method that was invoked by the <code>new</code> operator.</li>

      <li>Return the result of <es-xref target=
      "sec-construct-f-argumentslist">Construct</es-xref>(<i>F</i>, <i>argumentsList</i>).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If %Loader% is implemented as an <es-xref target=
    "sec-ecmascript-function-objects">ECMAScript function object</es-xref>, its [[Construct]]
    internal method will perform the above steps.</p>
