  <p>An <i>arguments object</i> is an exotic object whose array index properties map to the formal
  parameters bindings of an invocation of a non-strict function.</p>

  <p>Exotic arguments objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects. They also have a
  [[ParameterMap]] internal slot.</p>

  <p>Exotic arguments objects provide alternative definitions for the following internal methods.
  All of the other exotic arguments object essential internal methods that are not defined below
  are as specified in <es-xref target=
