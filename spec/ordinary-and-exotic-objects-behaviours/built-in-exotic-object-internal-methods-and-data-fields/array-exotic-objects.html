<es-clause title="Array Exotic Objects" anchor="sec-array-exotic-objects">
  <p>An <i>Array object</i> is an exotic object that gives special treatment to a certain class of
  property names. A property name <es-nt>P</es-nt> (in the form of a String value) is an <i>array
  index</i> if and only if <es-xref target="sec-tostring">ToString</es-xref>(<es-xref target=
  "sec-touint32">ToUint32</es-xref>(<i>P</i>)) is equal to <es-nt>P</es-nt> and <es-xref target=
  "sec-touint32">ToUint32</es-xref>(<i>P</i>) is not equal to 2<sup>32</sup> âˆ’1. A property whose
  property name is an array index is also called an <i>element</i>. Every Array object has a
  <code>length</code> property whose value is always a nonnegative integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>
  . The value of the <code>length</code> property is numerically greater than the name of every
  property whose name is an array index; whenever a property of an Array object is created or
  changed, other properties are adjusted as necessary to maintain this invariant. Specifically,
  whenever a property is added whose name is an array index, the <code>length</code> property is
  changed, if necessary, to be one more than the numeric value of that array index; and whenever
  the <code>length</code> property is changed, every property whose name is an array index whose
  value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted. This constraint applies only
  to own properties of an Array object and is unaffected by <code>length</code> or array index
  properties that may be inherited from its prototypes.</p>

  <p>Exotic Array objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects. They also have an
  [[ArrayInitialisationState]] internal slot.</p>

  <p>Exotic Array objects always have a non-configurable property named <b>"length"</b>.</p>

  <p>Exotic Array objects provide an alternative definition for the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal
  method. Except for that internal method, exotic Array objects provide all of the other essential
  internal methods as specified in <es-xref target=
  "sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">9.1</es-xref>.</p>
