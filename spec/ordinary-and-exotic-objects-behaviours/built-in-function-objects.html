<es-clause title="Built-in Function Objects" anchor="sec-built-in-function-objects">
  <p>The built-in function objects defined in this specification may be implemented as either
  ECMAScript function objects (<es-xref target=
  "sec-ordinarycreatefromconstructor">9.1.14</es-xref>) whose behaviour is provided using
  ECMAScript code or as implementation provided exotic function objects whose behaviour is provided
  in some other manner. In either case, the effect of calling such functions must conform to their
  specifications.</p>

  <p>If a built-in function object is implemented as an exotic object it must have the ordinary
  object behaviour specified in <es-xref target=
  "sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">9.1</es-xref> except [[GetOwnProperty]]
  which must be as specified in <es-xref target=
  "sec-ordinarycreatefromconstructor">9.1.14</es-xref>. All such exotic function objects also have
  [[Prototype]] and [[Extensible]] internal slots.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function object initially has the
  %FunctionPrototype% object (<es-xref target=
  "sec-properties-of-the-function-prototype-object">19.2.3</es-xref>) as the initial value of its
  [[Prototype]] <es-xref target="sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal
  slot</es-xref>.</p>

  <p>The behaviour specified for each built-in function via algorithm steps or other means is the
  specification of the [[Call]] behaviour for that function with the [[Call]]
  <es-nt>thisArgument</es-nt> providing the <span class="value">this</span> value and the [[Call]]
  <es-nt>argumentsList</es-nt> providing the named parameters for each built-in function. If the
  built-in function is implemented as an <es-xref target=
  "sec-ecmascript-function-objects">ECMAScript function object</es-xref> then this specified
  behaviour must be implemented by the ECMAScript code that is the body of the function. Built-in
  functions that are ECMAScript function objects must be strict mode functions.</p>

  <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the
  [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
  function. When a built-in constructor is called as part of a <code>new</code> expression the
  <es-nt>argumentsList</es-nt> parameter of the invoked [[Construct]] internal method provides the
  values for the built-in constructorâ€™s named parameters.</p>

  <p>Built-in functions that are not constructors do not have a <code>prototype</code> property
  unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.</p>

  <p>If a built-in function object is not implemented as an ECMAScript function it must have a
  [[Realm]] <es-xref target="sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">internal
  slot</es-xref> and a [[Call]] internal method that conforms to the following definition:</p>
