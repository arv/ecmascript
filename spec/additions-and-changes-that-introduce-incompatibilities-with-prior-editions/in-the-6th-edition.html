  <p><a href="#sec-iteration-statements">13.6</a> : Prior to Edition 6, an initialisation
  expression could appear as part of the <i>VariableDeclaration</i> that precedes the
  <code>in</code> keyword. The value of that expression was always discarded. In Edition 6, the
  <i>ForBind</i> in that same position does not allow the occurance of such an initialiser.</p>

  <p><a href="#sec-try-statement">13.14</a> : In Edition 6, it is an early error for a
  <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> clause to contained a <code>var</code> declaration for the same
  <es-nt>Identifier</es-nt> that appears as the <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> clause parameter. In previous
  editions, such a variable declaration would be instantiated in the enclosing variable environment
