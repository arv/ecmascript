  <p>9: In Edition 6, Function calls are not allowed to return a <es-xref target=

  <p><es-xref target="sec-iteration-statements">13.6</es-xref>: In Edition 6, a terminating
  semi-colon is no longer required at the end of a do-while statement.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-iteration-statements">13.6</es-xref>: Prior to Edition 6, an
  initialisation expression could appear as part of the <i>VariableDeclaration</i> that precedes
  the <code>in</code> keyword. The value of that expression was always discarded. In Edition 6, the
  <i>ForBind</i> in that same position does not allow the occurance of such an initialiser.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-try-statement">13.14</es-xref>: In Edition 6, it is an early error for a
  <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> clause to contained a <code>var</code> declaration for the same
  <es-nt>Identifier</es-nt> that appears as the <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> clause parameter. In previous
  editions, such a variable declaration would be instantiated in the enclosing variable environment
  but the declarationâ€™s <es-nt>Initialiser</es-nt> value would be assigned to the
  <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> parameter.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-method-definitions">14.3</es-xref> In Edition 6, the function objects
  that are created as the values of the [[Get]] or [[Set]] attribute of accessor properties in an
  <es-nt>ObjectLiteral</es-nt> are not constructor functions. In Edition 5, they were
  constructors.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-object.create">19.1.2.2</es-xref> and <es-xref target=
  "sec-object.defineproperties">19.1.2.3</es-xref>: In Edition 6, all property additions and
  changes are processed, even if one of them throws an exception. If an exception occurs during
  such processing, the first such exception is thrown after all propertie are processed. In Edition
  5, processing of property additions and changes immediately terminated when the first exception
  occurred.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-object.freeze">19.1.2.5</es-xref>: In Edition 6, if the argument to
  <code><es-xref target="sec-object.freeze">Object.freeze</es-xref></code> is not an object it is
  treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In Edition 5, a
  non-object argument always causes a <span class="value">TypeError</span> to be thrown.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-object.getownpropertydescriptor">19.1.2.6</es-xref>: In Edition 6, if the

  object an attempt is make to coerce the argument using <es-xref target=
  "sec-toobject">ToObject</es-xref>. If the coerecion is successful the result is used in place of

  thrown.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-object.getprototypeof">19.1.2.9</es-xref>: In Edition 6, if the argument

  not an object an attempt is make to coerce the argument using <es-xref target=
  "sec-toobject">ToObject</es-xref>. If the coerecion is successful the result is used in place of
  the original argument value. In Edition 5, a non-object argument always causes a <b>TypeError</b>
  to be thrown.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-object.isextensible">19.1.2.11</es-xref>: In Edition 6, if the argument
  to <code><es-xref target="sec-object.isextensible">Object.isExtensible</es-xref></code> is not an

  is make to coerce the argument using <es-xref target="sec-toobject">ToObject</es-xref>. If the

  non-configurable.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-properties-of-the-boolean-prototype-object">19.3.3</es-xref> In Edition
  6, the Boolean prototype object is not a Boolean instance. In previous editions it was a Boolean

  <p><es-xref target="sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object">22.1.3</es-xref> In Edition 6,

  "sec-string.prototype.touppercase">21.1.3.24</es-xref> In Edition 6, lowercase/upper conversion
  processing operates on code points. In previous editions such the conversion processing was only
  applied to individual code units. The only affected code points are those in the Deseret block of
  Unicode</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-string.prototype.trim">21.1.3.25</es-xref> In Edition 6, the
  <code><es-xref target="sec-string.prototype.trim">String.prototype.trim</es-xref></code> method
  is defined to recognize white space code points that may exists outside of the Unicode BMP.
  However, as of Unicode 6.1 no such code points are defined. In previous editions such code points
  would not have been recognized as white space.</p>

  <p><es-xref target="sec-properties-of-the-regexp-prototype-object">21.2.5</es-xref> In Edition 6,

  <code>source</code>, <code>global</code>, <code>ignoreCase</code>, and <code>multiline</code> are
