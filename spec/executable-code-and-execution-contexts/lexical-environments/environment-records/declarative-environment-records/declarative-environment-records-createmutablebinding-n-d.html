  <p>The concrete <es-xref target="sec-environment-records">Environment Record</es-xref> method
  CreateMutableBinding for declarative environment records creates a new mutable binding for the
  name <es-nt>N</es-nt> that is uninitialised. A binding must not already exist in this
  <es-xref target="sec-environment-records">Environment Record</es-xref> for <es-nt>N</es-nt>. If
  Boolean argument <es-nt>D</es-nt> is provided and has the value <b>true</b> the new binding is
  marked as being subject to deletion.</p>

  <ol class="proc">
    <li>Let <i>envRec</i> be the <es-xref target="sec-declarative-environment-records">declarative
