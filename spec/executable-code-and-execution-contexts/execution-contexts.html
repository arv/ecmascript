<es-clause title="Execution Contexts" anchor="sec-execution-contexts">
  <p>An <i>execution context</i> is a specification device that is used to track the runtime
  evaluation of code by an ECMAScript implementation. At any point in time, there is at most one
  execution context that is actually executing code. This is known as the <i>running</i> execution
  context. A stack is used to track execution contexts. The running execution context is always the
  top element of this stack. A new execution context is created whenever control is transferred
  from the executable code associated with the currently running execution context to executable
  code that is not associated with that execution context. The newly created execution context is
  pushed onto the stack and becomes the running execution context.</p>

  <p>An execution context contains whatever implementation specific state is necessary to track the
  execution progress of its associated code. Each execution context has at least the state
  components listed in <a href="#table-21">Table 21</a> .</p>

  <p>Evaluation of code by the running execution context may be suspended at various points defined
  within this specification. Once the running execution context has been suspended a different
  execution context may become the running execution context and commence evaluating its code. At
  some latter time a suspended execution context may again become the running execution context and
  continue evaluating its code at the point where it had previously been suspended. Transition of
  the running execution context status among execution contexts usually occurs in stack-like
  last-in/first-out manner. However, some ECMAScript features require non-LIFO transitions of the
  running execution context.</p>

  <p>The value is the <a href="#sec-code-realms">Realm</a> component of the running execution
  context is also called the <i>current <a href="#sec-code-realms">Realm</a></i> .</p>

  <p>Execution contexts for ECMAScript code have the additional state components listed in <a href=

  <p>The LexicalEnvironment and VariableEnvironment components of an execution context are always
  Lexical Environments. When an execution context is created its LexicalEnvironment and
  VariableEnvironment components initially have the same value. The value of the
  VariableEnvironment component never changes while the value of the LexicalEnvironment component
  may change during execution of code within an execution context.</p>

  <p>Execution contexts representing the evaluation of generator objects have the additional state
  components listed in <a href="#table-23">Table 23</a> .</p>

  <p>In most situations only the running execution context (the top of the execution context stack)
  is directly manipulated by algorithms within this specification. Hence when the terms
  “LexicalEnvironment”, and “VariableEnvironment” are used without qualification they are in
  reference to those components of the running execution context.</p>

  <p>An execution context is purely a specification mechanism and need not correspond to any
  particular artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for ECMAScript code to
  directly access or observe an execution context.</p>
