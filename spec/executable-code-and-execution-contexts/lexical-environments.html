<es-clause title="Lexical Environments" anchor="sec-lexical-environments">
  <p>A <i>Lexical Environment</i> is a specification type used to define the association of
  <es-nt>Identifiers</es-nt> to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting
  structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an <es-xref target=
  "sec-environment-records">Environment Record</es-xref> and a possibly null reference to an
  <i>outer</i> Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific
  syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a <es-nt>FunctionDeclaration</es-nt>, a
  <es-nt>BlockStatement</es-nt>, or a <es-nt>Catch</es-nt> clause of a <es-nt>TryStatement</es-nt>
  and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.</p>

  <p>An <i><es-xref target="sec-environment-records">Environment Record</es-xref></i> records the
  identifier bindings that are created within the scope of its associated Lexical Environment.</p>

  <p>The outer environment reference is used to model the logical nesting of Lexical Environment
  values. The outer reference of a (inner) Lexical Environment is a reference to the Lexical
  Environment that logically surrounds the inner Lexical Environment. An outer Lexical Environment
  may, of course, have its own outer Lexical Environment. A Lexical Environment may serve as the
  outer environment for multiple inner Lexical Environments. For example, if a
  <es-nt>FunctionDeclaration</es-nt> contains two nested <es-nt>FunctionDeclarations</es-nt> then
  the Lexical Environments of each of the nested functions will have as their outer Lexical
  Environment the Lexical Environment of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.</p>

  <p>A <i>global environment</i> is a Lexical Environment which does not have an outer environment.
  The global environment’s outer environment reference is <b>null</b>. A global environment’s
  environment record may be prepopulated with identifier bindings and includes an associated
  <i>global object</i> whose properties provide some of <es-xref target=
  "sec-global-environment-records">the global environment</es-xref>’s identifier bindings. This
  global object is the value of a global environment’s <code>this</code> binding. As ECMAScript
  code is executed, additional properties may be added to the global object and the initial
  properties may be modified.</p>

  <p>A method environment is a Lexical Environment that corresponds to the invocation of an
  <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-function-objects">ECMAScript function object</es-xref> that
  establishes a new <code>this</code> binding. A method environment also captures the state
  necessary to support <code>super</code> method invocations.</p>

  <p>Lexical Environments and <es-xref target="sec-environment-records">Environment
  Record</es-xref> values are purely specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any
  specific artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an ECMAScript program to
  directly access or manipulate such values.</p>
