<es-clause title="Runtime Semantics: Module Evaluation" anchor=
"sec-runtime-semantics-module-evaluation">
  <p>Module bodies are evaluated on demand, as late as possible. The loader uses the function
  <code><es-xref target="sec-ensureevaluated">EnsureEvaluated</es-xref></code>, defined below, to
  run scripts. The loader always calls <code><es-xref target=
  "sec-ensureevaluated">EnsureEvaluated</es-xref></code> before returning a Module object to user
  code.</p>

  <p>There is one way a module can be exposed to script before its body has been evaluated. In the
  case of an import cycle, whichever module is evaluated first can observe the others before they
  are evaluated. Simply put, we have to start somewhere: one of the modules in the cycle must run
  before the others.</p>
