  <es-clause title="Context-Free Grammars" anchor="sec-context-free-grammars">
    <p>A <i>context-free grammar</i> consists of a number of <i>productions</i>. Each production
    has an abstract symbol called a <i>nonterminal</i> as its <i>left-hand side</i>, and a sequence
    of zero or more nonterminal and <i>terminal</i> symbols as its <i>right-hand side</i>. For each
    grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>

    <p>A <i>chain production</i> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its
    right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.</p>

    <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the
    <i>goal symbol</i>, a given context-free grammar specifies a <i>language</i>, namely, the
    (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from
    repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for
    which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>

  <es-clause title="The Numeric String Grammar" anchor="sec-numeric-string-grammar">
    <p>Another grammar is used for translating Strings into numeric values. This grammar is similar
    to the part of the lexical grammar having to do with numeric literals and has as its terminal
    symbols <es-nt>SourceCharacter</es-nt>. This grammar appears in <a href=

    <p>Productions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having three colons
