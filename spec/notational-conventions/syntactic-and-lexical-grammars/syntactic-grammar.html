<es-clause title="The Syntactic Grammar" anchor="sec-syntactic-grammar">
  <p>The <i>syntactic grammar</i> for ECMAScript is given in clauses 11, 12, 13 and 14. This
  grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols (<a href=
  "#sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars">5.1.2</a> ). It defines a set of productions, starting from
  the goal symbol <es-nt>Script</es-nt>, that describe how sequences of tokens can form
  syntactically correct independent components of an ECMAScript programs.</p>

  <p>When a stream of characters is to be parsed as an ECMAScript script, it is first converted to
  a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical grammar; this stream of input
  elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The script is
  syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single
  instance of the goal nonterminal <es-nt>Script</es-nt>, with no tokens left over.</p>

  <p>Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon “<b>:</b>” as
  punctuation.</p>

  <p>The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 is actually not a complete
  account of which token sequences are accepted as correct ECMAScript scripts. Certain additional
  token sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only
  semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator
  characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are described by the grammar are not
  considered acceptable if a terminator character appears in certain “awkward” places.</p>

  <p>In certain cases in order to avoid ambiguities the syntactic grammar uses generalised
  productions that permit token sequences that are not valid ECMAScript scripts. For example, this
  technique is used in with object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more
  restrictive <i>supplemental grammar</i> is provided that further restricts the acceptable token
  sequences. In certain contexts, when explicitly specific, the input elements corresponding to
  such a production are parsed again using a goal symbol of a supplemental grammar. The script is
  syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single
  instance of the supplemental goal symbol, with no tokens left over.</p>
