<es-clause title="The Lexical and RegExp Grammars" anchor="sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars">
  <p>A <i>lexical grammar</i> for ECMAScript is given in <a href=
  "#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar">clause 11</a> . This grammar has as its terminal
  symbols characters (Unicode code units) that conform to the rules for
  <es-nt>SourceCharacter</es-nt> defined in <a href="#sec-ecmascript-language-source-code">clause
  10</a> .1. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol
  <es-nt>InputElementDiv</es-nt> or <es-nt>InputElementRegExp</es-nt>, that describe how sequences
  of such characters are translated into a sequence of input elements.</p>

  <p>Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic
  grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript <i>tokens</i>. These tokens are the reserved
  words, identifiers, literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line
  terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of the stream of input
  elements and guide the process of <a href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">automatic
  semicolon insertion</a> (<a href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">11.9</a> ). Simple white
  space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements
  for the syntactic grammar. A <es-nt>MultiLineComment</es-nt> (that is, a comment of the form
  “/*…*/” regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it
  contains no line terminator; but if a <es-nt>MultiLineComment</es-nt> contains one or more line
  terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of
  input elements for the syntactic grammar.</p>

  <p>A <i>RegExp grammar</i> for ECMAScript is given in <a href="#sec-patterns">21.2.1</a> . This
  grammar also has as its terminal symbols the characters as defined by
  <es-nt>SourceCharacter</es-nt>. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol
  <es-nt>Pattern</es-nt>, that describe how sequences of characters are translated into regular
  expression patterns.</p>

  <p>Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons
  “<b>::</b>” as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp grammars share some
  productions.</p>
