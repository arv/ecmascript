<es-clause title="Static Semantic Rules" anchor="sec-static-semantic-rules">
  <p>Context-free grammars are not sufficiently powerful to express all the rules that define
  whether a stream of input elements make up a valid ECMAScript script that may be evaluated. In
  some situations additional rules are needed that may be expressed using either ECMAScript
  algorithm conventions or prose requirements. Such rules are always associated with a production
  of a grammar and are called the <i>static semantics</i> of the production.</p>

  <p>Static Semantic Rules have names and typically are defined using an algorithm. Named Static
  Semantic Rules are associated with grammar productions and a production that has multiple
  alternative definitions will typically have for each alternative a distinct algorithm for each
  applicable named static semantic rule.</p>

  <p>Unless otherwise specified every grammar production alternative in this specification
  implicitly has a definition for a static semantic rule named Contains which takes an argument
  named <es-nt>symbol</es-nt> whose value is a terminal or nonterminal of the grammar that includes
  the associated production. The default definition of Contains is:</p>

  <ol class="proc">
    <li>For each terminal and nonterminal grammar symbol, <i>sym</i>, in the definition of this
    production do

      <ol class="block">
        <li>If <i>sym</i> is the same grammar symbol as <i>symbol</i>, return <b>true</b>.</li>

        <li>If <i>sym</i> is a nonterminal, then

          <ol class="block">
            <li>Let contained be the result of Contains for <i>sym</i> with argument
            <i>symbol</i>.</li>

            <li>If <i>contained</i> is <b>true</b>, return <b>true</b>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Return <b>false</b>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The above definition is explicitly over-ridden for specific productions.</p>

  <p>A special kind of static semantic rule is an Early Error Rule. Early error rules define early
  error conditions (see <a href="#sec-ecmascript-language-modules-and-scripts">clause 15</a> .2.3)
  that are associate with specific grammar productions. Evaluation of most early error rules are
  not explicitly invoked within the algorithms of this specification. A comforming implementation
  must, prior to the first evaluation of a <es-nt>Script</es-nt>, validate all of the early error
  rules of the productions used to parse that <es-nt>Script</es-nt>. If any of the early error
  rules are violated the <es-nt>Script</es-nt> is invalid and cannot be evaluated.</p>
