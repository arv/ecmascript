<es-clause title="Time Values and Time Range" anchor="sec-time-values-and-time-range">
  <p>A Date object contains a Number indicating a particular instant in time to within a
  millisecond. Such a Number is called a <i>time value</i>. A time value may also be <b>NaN</b>,
  indicating that the Date object does not represent a specific instant of time.</p>

  <p>Time is measured in ECMAScript in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. In time values leap
  seconds are ignored. It is assumed that there are exactly 86,400,000 milliseconds per day.
  ECMAScript Number values can represent all integers from –9,007,199,254,740,992 to
  9,007,199,254,740,992; this range suffices to measure times to millisecond precision for any
  instant that is within approximately 285,616 years, either forward or backward, from 01 January,
  1970 UTC.</p>

  <p>The actual range of times supported by ECMAScript Date objects is slightly smaller: exactly
  –100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days measured relative to midnight at the beginning of 01
  January, 1970 UTC. This gives a range of 8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds to either side of 01
  January, 1970 UTC.</p>

  <p>The exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 01 January, 1970 UTC is represented by the
  value <b>+0</b>.</p>
