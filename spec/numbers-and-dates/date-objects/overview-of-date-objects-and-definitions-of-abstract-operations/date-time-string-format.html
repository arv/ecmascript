<es-clause title="Date Time String Format" anchor="sec-date-time-string-format">
  <p>ECMAScript defines a string interchange format for date-times based upon a simplification of
  the ISO 8601 Extended Format. The format is as follows:
  <code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sss<i>Z</i></code></p>

  <p>Where the fields are as follows:</p>

  <p><code>YYYY</code>	is the decimal digits of the year 0000 to 9999 in the Gregorian
  calendar.</p>

  <p><code>-</code>		“<code>-</code>” (hyphen) appears literally twice in the string.</p>

  <p><code>MM</code>		is the month of the year from 01 (January) to 12 (December).</p>

  <p><code>DD</code>		is the day of the month from 01 to 31.</p>

  <p><code>T</code>		“<code>T</code>” appears literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of
  the time element.</p>

  <p><code>HH</code>	is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight as two decimal
  digits from 00 to 24.</p>

  <p><code>:</code>		“<code>:</code>” (colon) appears literally twice in the string.</p>

  <p><code>mm</code>	is the number of complete minutes since the start of the hour as two decimal
  digits from 00 to 59.</p>

  <p><code>ss</code>	is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute as two decimal
  digits from 00 to 59.</p>

  <p><code>.</code>		“<code>.</code>” (dot) appears literally in the string.</p>

  <p><code>sss</code>	is the number of complete milliseconds since the start of the second as three
  decimal digits.</p>

  <p><code>Z</code>	is the time zone offset specified as “<code>Z</code>” (for UTC) or either
  “<code>+</code>” or “<code>-</code>” followed by a time expression <code>HH:mm</code></p>

  <p class="Note">This format includes date-only forms:</p>
  <pre class="Note">
YYYY<br>YYYY-MM<br>YYYY-MM-DD
</pre>

  <p>It also includes “date-time” forms that consist of one of the above date-only forms
  immediately followed by one of the following time forms with an optional time zone offset
  appended:</p>
  <pre>
THH:mm<br>THH:mm:ss<br>THH:mm:ss.sss
</pre>

  <p>All numbers must be base 10. If the <code>MM</code> or <code>DD</code> fields are absent
  “<code>01</code>” is used as the value. If the <code>HH</code>, <code>mm</code>, or
  <code>ss</code> fields are absent “<code>00</code>” is used as the value and the value of an
  absent <code>sss</code> field is “<code>000</code>”. If the time zone offset is absent, the
  date-time is interpreted as a local time.</p>

  <p>Illegal values (out-of-bounds as well as syntax errors) in a format string means that the
  format string is not a valid instance of this format.</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>As every day both starts and ends with midnight, the two notations 00:00 and 24:00 are
    available to distinguish the two midnights that can be associated with one date. This means
    that the following two notations refer to exactly the same point in time: 1995-02-04T24:00 and
    1995-02-05T00:00</p>
  </es-note>

  <es-note>
    <p>There exists no international standard that specifies abbreviations for civil time zones
    like CET, EST, etc. and sometimes the same abbreviation is even used for two very different
    time zones. For this reason, ISO 8601 and this format specifies numeric representations of date
    and time.</p>
