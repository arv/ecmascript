<es-clause title="Extended years" anchor="sec-extended-years">
  <p>ECMAScript requires the ability to specify 6 digit years (extended years); approximately
  285,426 years, either forward or backward, from 01 January, 1970 UTC. To represent years before 0
  or after 9999, ISO 8601 permits the expansion of the year representation, but only by prior
  agreement between the sender and the receiver. In the simplified ECMAScript format such an
  expanded year representation shall have 2 extra year digits and is always prefixed with a + or â€“
  sign. The year 0 is considered positive and hence prefixed with a + sign.</p>
