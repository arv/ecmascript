<es-clause title="The String Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">
  <p>The String type is the set of all finite ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned
  integer values (“elements”). The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a
  running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code
  unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These positions
  are indexed with nonnegative integers. The first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element
  (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements (i.e., 16-bit
  values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore contains no elements.</p>

  <p>Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is interpreted as a single
  UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not place any restrictions or requirements on the
  sequence of code units in a String value, so they may be ill-formed when interpreted as UTF-16
  code unit sequences. Operations that do not interpret String contents treat them as sequences of
  undifferentiated 16-bit unsigned integers. No operations ensure that Strings are in a normalized
  form. Only operations that are explicitly specified to be language or locale sensitive produce
  language-sensitive results</p>

  <es-note>
    <p>The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and
    high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source code is in Normalised Form C, string literals
    are guaranteed to also be normalised, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape
    sequences.</p>
  </es-note>

  <p>Some operations interpret String contents as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points. In that case
  the interpretation is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A code unit in the range 0 to 0xD7FF or in the range 0xE000 to 0xFFFF is interpreted as a
      code point with the same value.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit <es-nt>c1</es-nt> is in the range
      0xD800 to 0xDBFF and the second code unit <es-nt>c2</es-nt> is in the range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF,
      is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a code point with the value (<es-nt>c1</es-nt> -
      0xD800) × 0x400 + (<es-nt>c2</es-nt> – 0xDC00) + 0x10000.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A code unit that is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF, but is not part of a surrogate pair, is
      interpreted as a code point with the same value.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</es-clause>
