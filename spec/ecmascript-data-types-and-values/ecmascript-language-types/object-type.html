<es-clause title="The Object Type" anchor="sec-object-type">
  <p>An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is either a data property, or
  an accessor property:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A <i>data property</i> associates a key value with an <es-xref target=
      "sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language value</es-xref> and a set of Boolean
      attributes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>An <i>accessor property</i> associates a key value with one or two accessor functions, and
      a set of Boolean attributes. The accessor functions are used to store or retrieve an
      <es-xref target="sec-ecmascript-language-types">ECMAScript language value</es-xref> that is
      associated with the property.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either an ECMAScript String value
  or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values, including the empty string, are valid as
  property keys.</p>

  <p>Property keys are used to access properties and their values. There are two kinds of access
  for properties: <i>get</i> and <i>set</i>, corresponding to value retrieval and assignment,
  respectively. The properties accessible via get and set access includes both <i>own
  properties</i> that are a direct part of an object and <i>inherited properties</i> which are
  provided by another associated object via a property inheritance relationship. Inherited
  properties may be either own or inherited properties of the associated object. Each own
  properties of an object must each have a key value that is distinct from the key values of the
  other own properties of that object.</p>

  <p>All objects are logically collections of properties, but there are multiple forms of objects
  that differ in their semantics for accessing and manipulating their properties. O<i>rdinary
  objects</i> are the most common form of objects and have the default object semantics. An
  <i>exotic object</i> is any form of object whose property semantics differ in any way from the
  default semantics.</p>
