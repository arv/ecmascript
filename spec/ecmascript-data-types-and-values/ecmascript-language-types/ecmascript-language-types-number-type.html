<es-clause title="The Number Type" anchor="sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type">
  <p>The Number type has exactly 18437736874454810627 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup> +3)
  values, representing the double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values as specified in the IEEE
  Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9007199254740990 (that is,
  2<sup>53</sup> −2) distinct “Not-a-Number” values of the IEEE Standard are represented in
  ECMAScript as a single special <b>NaN</b> value. (Note that the <b>NaN</b> value is produced by
  the program expression <code>NaN</code>.) In some implementations, external code might be able to
  detect a difference between various Not-a-Number values, but such behaviour is
  implementation-dependent; to ECMAScript code, all NaN values are indistinguishable from each
  other.</p>

  <p>There are two other special values, called <b>positive Infinity</b> and <b>negative
  Infinity</b>. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the
  symbols <span class="value">+∞</span> and <span class="value">−∞</span>, respectively. (Note that
  these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions <code>+Infinity</code>
  (or simply <code>Infinity</code>) and <code>-Infinity</code>.)</p>

  <p>The other 18437736874454810624 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup> ) values are called
  the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every
  finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative value having the same
  magnitude.</p>

  <p>Note that there is both a <b>positive zero</b> and a <b>negative zero</b>. For brevity, these
  values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols <span class="value">+0</span>
  and <span class="value">−0</span>, respectively. (Note that these two different zero Number
  values are produced by the program expressions <code>+0</code> (or simply <code>0</code>) and
  <code>-0</code>.)</p>

  <p>The 18437736874454810622 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>53</sup> −2) finite nonzero values
  are of two kinds:</p>

  <p>18428729675200069632 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup> −2<sup>54</sup> ) of them are normalised, having
  the form</p>

  <div class="math-display">
    <i>s</i> × <i>m</i> × 2<sup><i>e</i></sup>
  </div>

  <p>where <es-nt>s</es-nt> is +1 or −1, <es-nt>m</es-nt> is a positive integer less than
  2<sup>53</sup> but not less than 2<sup>52</sup> , and <es-nt>e</es-nt> is an integer ranging from
  −1074 to 971, inclusive.</p>

  <p>The remaining 9007199254740990 (that is, 2<sup>53</sup> −2) values are denormalised, having
  the form</p>

  <div class="math-display">
    <i>s</i> × <i>m</i> × 2<sup><i>e</i></sup>
  </div>

  <p>where <es-nt>s</es-nt> is +1 or −1, <es-nt>m</es-nt> is a positive integer less than
  2<sup>52</sup> , and <es-nt>e</es-nt> is −1074.</p>

  <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than
  2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the Number type (indeed, the integer 0 has two
  representations, <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>).</p>

  <p>A finite number has an <i>odd significand</i> if it is nonzero and the integer
  <es-nt>m</es-nt> used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it
  has an <i>even significand</i>.</p>

  <p>In this specification, the phrase “the Number value for <i>x</i>” where <es-nt>x</es-nt>
  represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even be an irrational number
  such as π) means a Number value chosen in the following manner. Consider the set of all finite
  values of the Number type, with <span class="value">−0</span> removed and with two additional
  values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely 2<sup>1024</sup> (which
  is +1 × 2<sup>53</sup> × 2<sup>971</sup> ) and −2<sup>1024</sup> (which is −1 × 2<sup>53</sup> ×
  2<sup>971</sup> ). Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to <es-nt>x</es-nt>. If
  two values of the set are equally close, then the one with an even significand is chosen; for
  this purpose, the two extra values 2<sup>1024</sup> and −2<sup>1024</sup> are considered to have
  even significands. Finally, if 2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with <span class=
  "value">+∞</span>; if −2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with <span class=
  "value">−∞</span>; if <span class="value">+0</span> was chosen, replace it with <span class=
  "value">−0</span> if and only if <es-nt>x</es-nt> is less than zero; any other chosen value is
  used unchanged. The result is the Number value for <es-nt>x</es-nt>. (This procedure corresponds
  exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE 754 “round to nearest” mode.)</p>

  <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in the range −2<sup>31</sup> through
  2<sup>31</sup> −1, inclusive, or in the range 0 through 2<sup>32</sup> −1, inclusive. These
  operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each such value to one of
  2<sup>32</sup> integer values. See the descriptions of the <es-xref target=
  "sec-toint32">ToInt32</es-xref> and <es-xref target="sec-touint32">ToUint32</es-xref> operators
  in <es-xref target="sec-toint32">7.1.5</es-xref> and <es-xref target=
  "sec-touint32">7.1.6</es-xref>, respectively.</p>
